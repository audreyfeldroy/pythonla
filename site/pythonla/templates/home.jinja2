        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>At every meeting there are <a href="/members">people with different 
        levels of programming ability and Python knowledge</a>. Don't be 
        intimidated about coming to a meeting.</p>

        <h3>Where do we meet?</h3>
        <p>Locations vary from event to event.  We've had meetings or events 
        at Evite, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Cars.com, KPCC, and 
        Cartwheel, with events to come at AOL, Border Stylo, and more.</p>

        <h3>What are the events like?</h3>
        <p>Meetups at companies are typically centered around 1-3 slide 
        presentations.  Sometimes people go out for food/drinks afterward.
        Hackathons are focused on getting together to code.  All events are
        beginner-friendly unless otherwise stated.</p>
